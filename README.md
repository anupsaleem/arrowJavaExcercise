Please run this program using the following commands:

javac TriangleDiagonalSum.java
java TriangleDiagonalSum

This approach is followed keeping in mind the constraints defined by the problem statement. In order to build traingle as an object we have used constructor to load a 2d array which represents the triangle. We can alternatively initialize the 2d array within the main method as well. I opted for the constructor since I wanted to apply the necessary knowledge and load the triangle as an object.
